Processing Customer Care Data with LLM

This project processes chat conversations between customers and support representatives to extract key information, including:

Customer Name

Order ID

Customer Email

Support Representative Name

Customer Sentiment

The extracted data is stored in an SQL database for efficient querying and retrieval. The project leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze and retrieve meaningful insights from the stored data.
