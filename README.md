# Processing Customer Care Data with LLM

This project demonstrates a solution for processing customer support chat data to extract critical details such as:

- **Customer Name**

- **Order ID**

- **Customer Email**

- **Support Representative Name**

- **Customer Sentiment**

The extracted information is systematically stored in an SQL database, enabling efficient data management and retrieval. Additionally, a Large Language Model (LLM) is employed to analyze the stored data and provide valuable insights based on user queries.
