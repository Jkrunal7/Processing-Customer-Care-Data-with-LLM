# Processing Customer Care Data with LLM 🤖📊

This project demonstrates a solution for processing customer support chat data to extract critical details such as:

- **Customer Name 🧑‍💼📋**

- **Order ID 🛒🔢**

- **Customer Email 📧💬**

- **Support Representative Name 🧑‍💻🤝**

- **Customer Sentiment 😊💔**

The extracted information is systematically stored in an SQL database 🗄️, enabling efficient data management and retrieval. Additionally, a Large Language Model (LLM) 🤖 is employed to analyze the stored data and provide valuable insights based on user queries 🔍📈.
